                (ii) error detection

1. Early Error detection
    Typescript cateches errors at compile time. This help prevent runtime errors and make your code mode reliable.

2. Improved Readablity & Maintainability
   Easier to read and understand. Other developed can quickly understand as well.

Javascript small-scale applications
Typescript medium-large applications

Typescript can be used for Client-Side as Reactjs & Angularjs ...
Typescript can be used for Server-Side with Nodejs

TypeScript VS JavaScript
------------------------

=> TypeScript
    i. static programming language
    ii. compiled (TypeScript Compiler = tsc)
    iii. compilation errors

=> JavaScript
    i. dynamic programming language
    ii. interpreted 
    iii. runtime errors
